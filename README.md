# Dropbox-like
Make a web-based file hosting software (like Dropbox) that would enable users to store and share files and folders with others across the Internet using file synchronization. Also, if a user has uploaded a file to your web server, then any changes he makes to his file locally should automatically be synced with the file on the server whenever there is Internet connectivity.
